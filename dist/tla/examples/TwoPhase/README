This directory contains two specifications:

Alternate
  A specification of a trivial alternation system.
  The only non-trivial aspect of the spec is the way it uses
  constant operator parameters to describe unspecified actions. 
  
TwoPhase
  A specification of a very simple hardware protocol called 
  two-phase handshaking, and a theorem asserting that it
  implements the Alternate spec under a refinement mapping.  
  It contains a TLA+ proof of this theorem, most of which that has been 
  checked by the TLAPS proof system.
