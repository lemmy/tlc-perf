This file contains three specifications:

Consensus
  A specification of the consensus problem.
  
Voting
  A specification of a very abstract consensus algorithm
  with a high level (unchecked) TLA+ proof that it implements
  the Consensus spec.  I believe that this proof has been
  expanded and checked with the TLAPS proof system by
  Jean-Baptiste Tristan.
  
Paxos
  A specification of a high-level version of the Paxos
  algorithm, a distributed message-passing algorithm that
  implements the Voting spec--and hence implements consensus.
  It contains a "first attempt" at an inductive invariant
  for the proof of implementation.  Tristan, who wrote most
  of a formal TLA+ proof of implementation, found that,
  while the invariant is indeed an invariant, it is not
  strong enough to be inductive.  (Note: because when he
  began the proof TLAPS did not handle records, Tristan
  rewrote the algorithm in terms of tuples for his proof.)
  
MCConsensus
MCVoting
MCPaxos
  Specifications that are used to model-check the corresponding
  three specifications above.  The Toolbox makes it unnecessary
  for the user to write such specs, essentially producing them
  itself from the models defined by the user.
