TLC.tla
   A copy of the standard module.


Exercises:

1. (a) Use TLC to print all Pythagorean triples <<i,j,k>> with 
   i^2 + j^2 = k^2 for natural numbers i,j,k \leq N. 
   Start with N=20.   (Don't be clever and use the formula for 
   generating Pythagorean triples; have TLC to it in a straightforward 
   fashion.)  

   (b) Next, get TLC to print only essentially Pythagorean triples--that
   is, Pythagorean triples <<i, j, k>> such that i \leq j and i,j, and k 
   have no common factor.  Try it with N = 50, 100, ...  .  Why does TLC 
   take longer to generate each example as N increases?
