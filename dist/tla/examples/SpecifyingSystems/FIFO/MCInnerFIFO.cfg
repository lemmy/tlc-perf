(* This is a configuration file for module MCInnerFIFOInstanced, which is  *)
(* a module for checking the specification InnerFIFO.                      *)
(***************************************************************************)

(***************************************************************************)
(* The values of every declared constant must be specified in a CONSTANT   *)
(* (or CONSTANTS) statement.  The CONSTANT and CONSTRAINT statements       *)
(* together define the model for which TLC is checking the specifications. *)
(***************************************************************************)
CONSTANTS
  Message = {m1, m2, m3}
    \* We let Message be a set consisting of three distinct elements
    \* m1, m2, and m3.
  qLen = 3
    \* We let qLen be 3, so TLC does not explore successor states of
    \* any state in which q has length greater than 3.


SPECIFICATION Spec
  \* This statement tells TLC that the specification is formula Spec.

CONSTRAINT qConstraint
  \* This statement tells TLC to use the state predicate qConstraint as
  \* a constraint, meaning that it will not explore successor states of
  \* any state it generates that does not satisfy qConstraint.

INVARIANT TypeInvariant
  \* This statement tells TLC to check that TypeInvariant is an
  \* invariant of the specification--that is, to check that Spec
  \* implies []TypeInvariant.
