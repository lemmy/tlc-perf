Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated.
Progress(12) at 2012-09-06 15:45:09: 38183 states generated (38,182 s/min), 10312 distinct states found (10,312 ds/min), 3940 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.9E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.0E-12
1572865 states generated, 262144 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 43.
Finished. (2012-09-06 15:46:08)
