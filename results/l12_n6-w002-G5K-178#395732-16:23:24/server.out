Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.0E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.8E-13
1283694 states generated, 262144 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 39.
