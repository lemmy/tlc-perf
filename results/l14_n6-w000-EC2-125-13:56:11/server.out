Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.9E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.0E-12
1572865 states generated, 262144 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 43.
